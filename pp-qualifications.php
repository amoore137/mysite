			<h3>Google Analytics for Beginners:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>Date Achieved: 16/12/2020</p>
			<p>I have recently completed the Google Analytics for Beginners Qualification. I decided to undertake this course because with the Digital Marketing technique of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) being of specific interest to me, Google Analytics is a platform I am keen to understand more about.</p>
			<p>Broadly, the course has taught me that Google Analytics is extremely important when undertaking SEO, due to the platform being vital for identifying areas of a website where SEO is needed and for collecting the results of campaigns. These can be seen through platform features, such as, Webpage Number of Users, Click Through Rate (CTR), Bounce Rate, and Conversion Rate.</p>
			<p>After finding the Google Analytics for Beginners Qualification both useful and enjoyable, I hope to complete the Advanced Google Analytics Qualification soon, to further expand my knowledge.</p>

    <p>Date Achieved: 17/12/2020</p>
	<p>I have also recently undertaken the Google Ads Search Qualification. I decided to complete this course because it provides a great insight into Google Search Campaigns, which has helped me to gain knowledge and understanding in this area of Digital Marketing. Specifically, the course was useful because it provided information on how the Bidding and the Auction for Google Search Ads takes place, how a businessâ€™ quality score can be increased and what businesses can do to optimise their content and improve their position in Google Search Results. This includes, using keywords, adapting website coding and utilising internal and external links.</p>
	<p>In addition to the Google Ads Search Qualification, which has proved extremely insightful, I am planning to complete similar Qualifications in Google Display Ads and Google Video Ads very soon, to increase my understanding of the Google Ads platform.</p>

			<h3>SEO Foundations Certification:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>Date Achieved: 19/12/2020</p>
			<p>The SEO Foundations Certification on LinkedIn Learning, was an insightful and worthwhile course because it covered several key topics, that have provided me with a solid introduction to Search Engine Optimization (SEO). These topics included, Link-Building, Content Planning, Technical SEO and Measuring SEO Effectiveness.</p>
			<p>After my completion of the SEO Foundations Certification and the SEO: Keyword Strategy Certification, which can be seen below, my next step is to undertake the other courses in the SEO Expert Series. These can be seen at the end of the next section.</p>

			<h3>SEO:Keyword Strategy Certification:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>Date Achieved: 21/12/2020</p>
			<p>The SEO: Keyword Strategy Certification on LinkedIn Learning was extremely useful to complete because it provided extensive information on how best to undertake Keyword Research. Advice in the course included using Google Search Console to discover what users are searching, using Keyword Research Tools, such as Google Trends and Word Tracker, to create a Keyword Seed List of 10-15 words/phrases, and create a spreadsheet to record elements, for example, each keyword, volume of searches, Click Through Rate and Competition.</p>
			<p>The additional courses I plan to undertake from the SEO Expert Series on LinkedIn Learning, so that I can carry on improving my knowledge and skills on this topic, are SEO: Link Building, SEO: Videos, Local SEO and International SEO.</p>
