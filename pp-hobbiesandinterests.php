			<h3>Marketing:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>I have a keen interest in Marketing that materialised after I thoroughly enjoyed the project of designing a promotional campaign for the Pathways to Property Summer School. The campaign consisted of three targeted social media posts that I constructed on Adobe Spark to attract Year 12 students to apply to the initiatives’ Online Summer School. I enjoyed this project because working with tools, such as Adobe Spark, allowed me to showcase my creativity when designing promotional material. Also, constructing the message I would send to students through social media was an interesting task, as I had to seriously consider their reaction to ensure the posts would be successful in persuading them to apply.</p>
			<p>In addition, I thoroughly enjoy the Digital Marketing element of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This is due to my fascination with how businesses can improve their position in search listings, through website changes prompted by tools, such as, Google Search Console. As stated on the ‘About Me’ page, to further develop my SEO and Digital Marketing skills, I have created this website as a place of practice and I have recently completed the <a class="button" href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Beginners Qualification</a> and <a class="button" href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google Ads Search Qualification</a> to broaden my Digital Marketing knowledge. </p>

    	<h3>Cricket:</h3>
	</header>
		<p>I thoroughly enjoy cricket and have participated in the sport at junior and senior level, playing for both Stalbridge and North Dorset Cricket Clubs since the age of 10 years old.</p>
		<p>Cricket is one of my favourite sports to play because I really enjoy working as a team to reach the goal of winning a match. Also, I am always driven to enhance my skills in Bowling, Fielding and especially Batting, with this being the area of my game where there is the greatest room for improvement.</p>

			<h3>Fishing:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>I have developed into a keen fisherman due to my enjoyment when working individually, as well as when operating as a team. I find working alone exciting because it allows me the opportunity to test my abilities and prove to myself and others that I can still operate well when relying solely on my own skills.</p>
			<p>The thrill I experience when fishing, that motivates me to participate in the sport, is due to my enjoyment of the challenge of being patient to be successful, when waiting for a bite. In addition, I regularly adapt my approach whilst fishing, to try and improve my chances of outwitting and therefore catching a fish.</p>

			<h3>Table Tennis:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>My interest in Table Tennis has evolved after I joined the society at Reading University this year. I participate in this sport because I have always relished the speed of Table Tennis and constantly want to improve my playing technique to reach a higher standard.</p>
			<p>As well as this, I have a keen interest in Table Tennis because when playing as a member of the society at Reading University I often compete against opponents that are more talented than myself and I therefore enjoy the challenge of trying to beat them.</p>
