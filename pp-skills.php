			<h3>Leadership:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>My leadership skills have improved significantly, after I managed over 20 Student Ambassadors when working as the Programme Delivery Support for Pathways to Property. In this position I was required to lead the group, by organising School Talks for Ambassadors, regularly contacting them to communicate available event spaces, booking travel and arranging educational resources.</p>
			<p>In addition, I have become a good leader from my time as a Barman at the Virginia Ash Pub. Whilst working in this position I regularly managed other employees, by undertaking responsibilities, for example, instructing them to complete tasks, delivering advice on how best to partake in specific activities, such as, pouring pints, cleaning areas of the establishment, and placing and taking orders from suppliers, and being there main point of contact if they ever had any queries while at work.</p>

			<h3>Communication:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>I have strong communication skills after participating in an array of team sports at junior and senior level. Through the activities of Cricket and Football, I have become a good communicator because I am always required to make my position on the pitch and next movement in the game known by teammates. This allows the collective to operate successfully.</p>
			<p>As well as this, I have become a skilled communicator because whilst operating as a Scorebox Attendant for Dorset County Cricket Club, I was required to regularly liaise with my fellow scorer and the two umpires on the pitch to ensure accuracy on the running-results of matches. This included communicaing with my fellow scorer to compare scoresheets and signalling to umpires after each ball, so they knew the correct outcome had been recorded.  </p>

			<h3>Time Management:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>The rapid increase in coursework on my Business and Management Degree at Reading University this year has helped my time management because I now plan each working day and prioritise tasks. This is needed to ensure every piece of coursework is submitted by its deadline, and enough time is allocated to each assignment for work to be completed to a high standard.</p>
			<p>Also, my time managament skills have improved after having to balance the activities of placing and receiving orders from suppliers whilst still serving customers, when working as a Barman at The Virginia Ash Pub.</p>

			<h3>Product Promotion:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>Working at several fishing trade shows for C.C.Moore & Co Ltd has aided me in becoming an experienced Product Promoter, after I regularly talked to customers about the benefits of products and pushed certain goods that the company were selling at different times, to ensure the business received as much profit as possible from these shows.</p>
			<p>As well as this, I have become a skilled Product Promoter after regularly attending school talks whilst working for Pathways to Property. During these talks, I persuaded students to sign-up to the Summer School. This task challenged and developed my skills as a Product Promoter because students were often reluctant to agree participation in an educational programme during their summer holidays, meaning I had to be convincing and persistent in my approach.</p>

			<h3>Attention to Detail:</h3>
		</header>
			<p>I have developed an impressive attention to detail after managing the Twitter and Instagram accounts for Pathways to Property during my placement year. When constructing and submitting posts I was always required to thoroughly checked the title, image, caption and location, as any slight mistake could mislead consumers and negatively impact the message.</p>
			<p>In addition, whilst working at C.C.Moore & Co Ltd, I regularly checked for accuracy on detailed product labels. This has improved my ability to identify mistakes and increased my threshold to be patient and undertake tasks in a methodical and particular fashion.</p>
